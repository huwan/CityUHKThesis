Let us formally define the problem as follows:
\begin{definition}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Key Components}

Our solution consists of three main components:

\subsubsection{Component Alpha}
\lipsum[5]

The mathematical formulation for Component Alpha is:
\begin{equation}
\alpha(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot f_i(x) + \beta

\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Component Beta}
\lipsum[6]

Component Beta utilizes the following optimization procedure:
\begin{equation}
\beta^* = \arg\min_{\beta} \sum_{j=1}^{m} L(y_j, \hat{y}_j(\beta))
\label{eq:component-beta}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Component Gamma}

The integration mechanism is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:papertwo-integration}.
